Certainly! Let's break down **Option 1: Dockerizing the Django App** in more detail. This approach allows your friend to run the Django application on NixOS while still having the flexibility to deploy it on Heroku (or other cloud platforms) if needed.

### Step-by-Step: Dockerizing the Django App

#### 1. **Install Docker on NixOS**
   First, your friend needs Docker installed on their NixOS system. To do this, they can add the following to their NixOS configuration (`/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`):

   ```nix
   {
     virtualisation.docker.enable = true;
   }
   ```

   Then, run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to apply the changes.

#### 2. **Prepare the Django Application**
   Assuming your friend already has a Django project with a `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml` for newer versions), they need to make sure the project is ready for containerization.

   The basic structure of a Django project looks like this:

   ```
   my-django-app/
   ├── manage.py
   ├── myapp/
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── other_project_files/
   ```

#### 3. **Create a Dockerfile**
   In the root of the Django project (`my-django-app/`), create a `Dockerfile`. This file tells Docker how to build the container image. Here's a basic `Dockerfile` for Django with Gunicorn as the application server and a PostgreSQL database.

   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Expose the port the app runs on
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Define environment variable for Django to allow all hosts
   ENV DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*

   # Run the Django development server (or use Gunicorn in production)
   CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "myproject.wsgi:application"]
   ```

   This `Dockerfile` does the following:
   - Starts with the official Python 3.9 slim image.
   - Sets `/app` as the working directory.
   - Copies the Django project files into the container.
   - Installs dependencies using `pip` from the `requirements.txt`.
   - Exposes port `8000`, which is the default port for Django’s development server (and for Gunicorn).
   - Sets an environment variable `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to allow any host (for development purposes).
   - Runs the Django app using Gunicorn (which is more production-ready than Django’s default development server).

#### 4. **Build the Docker Image**
   Once the `Dockerfile` is in place, your friend can build the Docker image. Open a terminal in the root of the Django project and run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-django-app .
   ```

   This will create a Docker image tagged `my-django-app`.

#### 5. **Run the Docker Container Locally**
   After the image is built, your friend can run the container locally to test it:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 my-django-app
   ```

   This will run the Django app inside the Docker container and map port 8000 from the container to port 8000 on the host machine. They can then access the Django app by going to `http://localhost:8000`.

#### 6. **Docker Compose (Optional for Multi-Container Setup)**
   If your friend’s Django app uses a database (e.g., PostgreSQL), they can use **Docker Compose** to define multiple services (like Django and PostgreSQL) in a single configuration. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: myuser
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
         POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
       volumes:
         - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     web:
       build: .
       command: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myproject.wsgi:application
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db

   volumes:
     pgdata:
   ```

   This `docker-compose.yml` defines two services:
   - `db`: The PostgreSQL database.
   - `web`: The Django app, built from the local directory (`.`).

   Your friend can start the services with:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will bring up both the database and Django app. The app will be accessible on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### 7. **Deploying to Heroku**
   If your friend still wants to deploy to Heroku, they can use Docker to push their app to Heroku. Here’s how to do it:

   1. **Install Heroku CLI** (if not already installed).
   2. **Login to Heroku** via the command line:

      ```bash
      heroku login
      ```

   3. **Create a Heroku app** (if not already created):

      ```bash
      heroku create my-django-app
      ```

   4. **Push the Docker container to Heroku**:

      ```bash
      heroku container:login
      heroku container:push web --app my-django-app
      heroku container:release web --app my-django-app
      ```

   This will push the Docker container to Heroku and release it as a web app.

#### 8. **Set Up Django for Production**
   Before deploying to production (either locally or on Heroku), your friend should make sure the Django app is ready for production. This includes:

   - Setting up the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the `settings.py` file (e.g., `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` for testing or specific domains for production).
   - Configuring a production database (like PostgreSQL on Heroku or another external database).
   - Running `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather static files.
   - Setting up environment variables for secrets like the Django `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, etc.
   - Using Gunicorn or another WSGI server to run the app instead of the default Django development server.

### Summary
This approach allows your friend to easily containerize their Django app and run it locally on NixOS while maintaining flexibility for deployment on platforms like Heroku or others. The Docker container ensures the environment is consistent across all stages of development and production.
